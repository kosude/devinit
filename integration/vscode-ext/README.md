# VS Code integration for Devinit

This extension provides an interface to integrate [devinit](https://github.com/kosude/devinit) into VS Code.

Devinit is a command-line utility written in Rust that provides the ability to write templates for files and projects and interactively apply them to
make boilerplate less annoying.

For more information, see the documentation located in the main repository's README
[here](https://github.com/kosude/devinit?tab=readme-ov-file#readme).
